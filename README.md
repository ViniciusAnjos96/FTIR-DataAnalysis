FTIR Spectral Analysis with Python (Google Colab)
Last updated: May 18, 2025.

This script was developed for the spectral analysis of FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) data.

====================
DATA FORMAT REQUIRED
====================
- The input file must be in `.csv` or `.xlsx` format.
- Each row should represent an individual FTIR spectrum.
- The first row must contain the wavenumber values.
- The first column of each row (i.e., the first column of the file) must contain the class label for the corresponding spectrum.

Make sure your file follows this format to ensure proper functioning of the script.
